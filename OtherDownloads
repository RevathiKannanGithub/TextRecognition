Apart from packages at SYSTEM level and at Virtual Environment level, we need to download pre-trained model EAST Detector for Text Detection :
OpenCV’s EAST(Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detection ) text detector is a deep learning model. OpenCV’s text detector implementation of EAST 
is quite robust, capable of localizing text even when it’s blurred, reflective, or partially obscured.

Pre-trained model can be downloaded at:
